### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ›  I'm currently working on an experimental distributed database called [LBADD](https://github.com/tomarrell/lbadd). If you're interested in contributing, feel free to reach out!

ðŸ–‹ I also maintain a blog where I write things from time to time. For example, [how I built the keyboard](https://blog.tomarrell.com/post/how_to_prevent_rsi) that I use on a daily basis. Feel free to check it out [here](https://blog.tomarrell.com/).
